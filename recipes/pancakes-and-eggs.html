        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
           Its early sunday morning, you've got your eggs, butter, mayple syrup and flower out on the counter. Your partner is watching you from across the room, excited for the "Best pancakes you'll ever have". They think you're going to make the kitchen look like a warzone and probably scorch the microwave that hangs above your stove. But there is deception afoot, the flower has been dumped out and replaced with pre-made pancake mix. Just add water, right? 
        </p>
        <p>
            So, you hyped up your mythical, <em>and by mythical I do mean made up</em>, from scratch pancakes. I assume you've already replaced the flower? But you forgot to take a picture of the instructions, didn't you? No need to fear, I've written them down for just such an occasion.
